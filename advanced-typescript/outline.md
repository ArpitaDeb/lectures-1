### What is TypeScript?
* A [superset](https://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/superset) of JavaScript
* TypeScript adds types to JavaScript
* TypeScript is [transpiled](https://scotch.io/tutorials/javascript-transpilers-what-they-are-why-we-need-them) into JavaScript as part of a build step
* **All** JavaScript is valid TypeScript
* Catches errors before they are discovered at [runtime](https://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/definition/runtime) (Yay! No more `cannot read property 'x' of undefined` errors!)
