## Intro (30 minutes)

- overview of take home challenges

- why take home challenges are better
  - they allow you to spend as much time as you need to perfect the code
  - you are working in a comfortable environment on your own terms without someone watching your every move
  - they are a better showcase of your problem solving skills
  - you have the time to research new technologies/frameworks/libraries
  - you get a feeling for the kind of work that you will be doing day-to-day (KV example)
  - you don't have to miss work like you would for a multi-hour whiteboarding interview
  - you can go above and beyond

- drawbacks
  - time
  - you will lose at least an evening/weekend vs a one and done interview

- basic types of take home challenges
  - front-end challenges (build a user interface, display data from an external api, build a game)
  - full-stack challenge (build an entire application or serve data from another api)
  - back-end challenge (build an api possibly backed by data)

- mistakes to avoid
  - the challenge is beyond your current skillset
  - you just don't have the time to complete the challenge/to the degree that you would like
  - multiple challenges mean learning multiple new things (possibly too many new things at once)
  - submitting sloppy code
  - lack of upfront planning

- planning
  - understand the requirements and ask appropriate questions
  - identify what/if any technical decisions you get to make
  - testing?
  - work incrementally/break the problem down and set an order for the tasks to be completed

- final thoughts
  - make it work
  - make it pretty
  - make it fast
  - be prepared to discuss the code that you've written
  - always ask if you can make the code public (contributions to private repos still show up in your github contributions)
  - ask yourself what the employer is looking to get out of the challenge
  - focus on the MVP before moving on to stretch
