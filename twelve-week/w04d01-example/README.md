### Semantic HTML
* From [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics)
  > In programming, Semantics refers to the meaning of a piece of code â€” for example "what effect does running that line of JavaScript have?", or "what purpose or role does that HTML element have" (rather than "what does it look like?".)
