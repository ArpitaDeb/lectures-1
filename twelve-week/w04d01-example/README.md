### To Do

* [ ] Intro to CSS
* [ ] Selectors
* [ ] DevTools
* [ ] Box Model
* [ ] CSS Resets
* [ ] Box-sizing

You'll notice that while this week has more new concepts (every week will), our approach to teaching with you will adjust a bit. Overall, as the weeks progress, there is less emphasis on giving you all the resources, functions, and tips that you need to complete an activity. There will be more expectation for you to poke around until you find an answer.

This means that during a lecture, if/when a new concept comes up that you don't fully understand, consider writing it down and researching it post-lecture. There are too many new things that you'll encounter directly or tangentially in the morning lecture for everyone to ask "What's XYZ?". That is a question for Google before it should become one for us. We're happy to discuss XYZ with you once you've spent some time trying to understand it for yourself.

### Semantic HTML
* From [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics)
  > In programming, Semantics refers to the meaning of a piece of code â€” for example "what effect does running that line of JavaScript have?", or "what purpose or role does that HTML element have" (rather than "what does it look like?".)
* We've already seen semantics when we use descriptive names for variables and functions in JavaScript
* HTML gives us access to many [semantic tags](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics) to better describe our documents
* Consider: 

  ```html
  <div>My Awesome Page</div>
  <div>
    <div>
      <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/150" />
      <div>A picture of me</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div>More about me</div>
  <div>Copyright &copy; 2019</div>
  ```

  Versus:

  ```html
  <header>My Awesome Page</header>
  <main>
    <figure>
      <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/150" />
      <figcaption>A picture of me</figcaption>
    </figure>
  </main>
  <aside>More about me</aside>
  <footer>Copyright &copy; 2019</footer>
  ```

* By using semantics, we can convey the _meaning_ of our markup to other developers who read our code as well as people using assistive devices to browse our site

### **C**ascading **S**tyle **S**heets
* CSS is a [programming language](https://notlaura.com/css-is-a-programming-language/) that allows us to style our webpages
* Can be added inline, embedded in a style element, or stored in an external file and linked in the head of the HTML file

#### Inline

```html
<div style="width: 90px; height: 250px;"></div>
```

#### Style Element

```html
<style>
  body {
    color: lawngreen;
  }
</style>
```

#### External Stylesheet

```css
/* styles.css */
body {
  background-color: lightsalmon;
}
```

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="./styles.css" />
```

### Selectors
* CSS is based around using [selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors) to apply certain styles to specific areas of the document

```cs
/* syntax */
selector list {
  property: value;
}

/* we can select by element name */
div { ... }
/* comma separate to style multiple elements */
div, p, a, aside { ... }

/* by class name */
.my-class { ... }
/* element with a class name */
div.my-class { ... }

/* by id */
#my-id { ... }
/* element with id */
div#my-id { ... }
```

### DevTools
* The Chrome DevTools are your best friend when developing client-side
* Make heavy use of the `Elements` tab and the `Styles` section

### Box Model
* 


![opinions opinions opinions](https://media.makeameme.org/created/opinions-opinions-everywhere-j7cvn5.jpg)

Front-end development is a chance for us to express our creativity. Creativity leads to many different ways of solving the same problem. Multiple ways of doing the same thing lead to people forming opinions about "the best way" to do something. Having opinions isn't a bad thing! Just keep in mind that the articles you read, videos you watch, and the mentors that help you, may have different, sometimes conflicting, approaches.
