# W2D4 - Promises

### To Do
- [ ] Introduction to Promises
- [ ] Sequencing of async tasks without the "callback waterfall" (callback hell) problem
- [ ] Error handling with Promises (vs callbacks)
- [ ] Parallelizing async things (Promise.race and Promise.all)

### Promises
- An object that may (or may not) resolve to a value in the future
- Offers an alternative solution to async programming
- Will be in one of three possible states:
  - `pending`: the promise has yet to resolve to a value or reject with an error
  - `fulfilled`: the promise resolved successfully to a value
  - `rejected`: the promise was rejected with an error
