* Primitive data types
* Objects Fundamentals
  * Their advantages for data lookup vs arrays
  * How they are passed to functions
* Functions as object methods
  * Using `this` when inside an object's function

  Primitive types in JavaScript (string and number are primitives, passed directly by value)
  The difference between a primitive vs an object
  Key-value pairs as a concept.
  Give a mention to the various names given to the data type. Associative array, map, dictionary, hash (without getting into abstract data types or anything like that); but focus mostly on Objects.

## Preamble
- Students should not be trying to replicate the same code on their screen and instead be paying attention and collaborating/questioning the code that's being written on screen
- This discussion is meant to facilitate a deeper learning of the coding concepts

## Tips for Success
- Ask for assistance, even if it's just a code review
- Ask questions during lecture
- Refine your Googling skills

## Imposter Syndrome
- Everyone suffers from it at some point or another
