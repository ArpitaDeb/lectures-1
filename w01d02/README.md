### Problem Solving Approaches

> Without requirements or design, programming is the art of adding bugs to an empty text file.
>
> -- <cite>Louis Srygley</cite>

* We have a variety of different approaches available to us as problem solvers
* Breaking the problem into pieces
* Errors are your friend

### Git Workflow

* To create a git repository in a directory, run `git init`
* To add files to the staging area, use `git add <filename>` or `git add .` to add all changes
* Commit your changes using `git commit -m 'a meaningful commit message'`
* Finally, push your code to github using `git push origin master`
