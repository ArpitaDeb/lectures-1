Goals
- Curriculum overview (using these [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1m3R_aN4S5YoCBmXRbjaZQGatygWyZXYLcN-fkcP_HWA))
- Writing code incrementally
- Problem solving tips
- Basic git workflow (init -> add -> commit -> push)

Problem:
> Write a node program that takes in an unlimited number of command line arguments, goes through each and prints out the sum of them. If any argument is not a whole number, skip it. Do support negative numbers though.
