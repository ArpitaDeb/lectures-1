Goals
- Curriculum overview (using these [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1m3R_aN4S5YoCBmXRbjaZQGatygWyZXYLcN-fkcP_HWA)) (~15 minutes)
- Writing code incrementally
- Problem solving tips
- Basic git workflow (init -> add -> commit -> push)

Upfront
- Students should not be trying to code-along during lecture
- This is a discussion meant to facilitate a deeper learning of the coding concepts

Problem:
> Write a node program that takes in an unlimited number of command line arguments, goes through each and prints out the sum of them. If any argument is not a whole number, skip it. Do support negative numbers though.

Keep in Mind
- Refactor the solution into functions as you go
- Write in small steps (incrementally)
- Run eslint
- Proper indentation of code
- Avoid copy/paste
- Errors are your friend
- Google => StackOverflow => Documentation (MDN)
- When to ask for mentor support? 15 minute rule, don't say "it's not working"
- Use the Node REPL to play with the code
- Show how MDN says things like Array.prototype.arrayMethod
- Stack Overflow is often outdated
